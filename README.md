**WeiBI (web-based platform): Enriching integrated interaction network with increased coverage and functional proteins from genome-wide experimental OMICS data**
Abstract Many molecular system biology approaches recognize various interactions and functional associations of proteins that occur in cellular processing. Further understanding of the characterization technique reveals noteworthy information. These types of known and predicted interactions, gained through multiple resources, are thought to be important for experimental data to satisfy comprehensive and quality needs. The current work proposes the “WeiBI (WeiBiologicalInteractions)” database that clarifies direct and indirect partnerships associated with biological interactions. This database contains information concerning protein’s functional partnerships and interactions along with their integration into a statistical model that can be computationally predicted for humans. This novel approach in WeiBI version 1.0 collects information using an improved algorithm by transferring interactions between more than 115570 entries, allowing statistical analysis with the automated background for the given inputs for functional enrichment. This approach also allows the input of an entity’s list from a database along with the visualization of subsets as an interaction network and successful performance of the enrichment analysis for a gene set. This wisely improved algorithm is user-friendly, and its accessibility and higher accuracy make it the best database for exploring interactions among genomes’ network and reflects the importance of this study.

**Availability**
The WeiBI server is currently undergoing maintenance and will be freely accessible as soon as possible. Stay tuned for upcoming updates.

**NOTE**
WeiBi helps to identify entity interactions, not only protein-protein but also protein-gene with a confidence score. So the given PHP file has all the detail and algorithm but it won't work at the moment because of missing .sql file. We will add this data as soon as possible.

We recommend no dissemenation of this data other than educational purposes, and must be practiced ONLY for learning purposes.
